                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and<br>
                       the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs<br>
                       APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="italic">bundles
                        of reusable, nestable code.</span>You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover<br>
                       how components work in React Native.</p>

                    <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with<br>
                       JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get<br>
                       you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                    </p>
                    <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React: </p>
                    <p><span class="bold">+ components.</span>The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,<br>
                         approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<br>
                        <span class="background"> &lt;Text>Hello, I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is<br>
                        JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="background">name</span> for the cat, name, and<br>
                        embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="background">&lt;Text></span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">+ state. </span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,<br>
                        state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over <br>
                        time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

                    </div>
                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that<br>
                       takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a<br>
                       function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.<br>
                       In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there<br>
                       Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
