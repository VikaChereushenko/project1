        <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup<br>
            instructions, they've moved to <u>their own section.</u> Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation,<br>

        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and<br>
           the app platform’s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s<br>
           APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="italic">bundles
            of reusable, nestable code.</span>You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s cover<br>
           how components work in React Native.</p>

    <section class="container">
        <div>
            <h3>react fundamentals</h3><span>chapter3</span>
        </div>
        <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with<br>
           JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get<br>
           you started or can serve as a refresher course.
        </p>
        <p>We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React: </p>
        <p><span class="bold">+ components.</span>The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,<br>
             approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<br>
            <span class="background"> &lt;Text>Hello, I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is<br>
            JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="background">name</span> for the cat, name, and<br>
            embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="background">&lt;Text></span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for “properties”.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">+ state. </span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,<br>
            state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over <br>
            time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
        </p>

            <h3>handling text input</h3><span>chapter4</span>    
        </div>
        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that<br>
           takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a<br>
           function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.<br>
           In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there<br>
           Bob" would be translated as "🍕 🍕".</p>
